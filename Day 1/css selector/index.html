    <h1>Why to Learn java Programming?</h1>
    <p>
      Java is a MUST for students and working professiona;so to become a great
      Software Engineer specially when they are working in software
      <br />Development Domain.I will list down some of the key advantages of
      learning java Programming:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Object Oriented</dt>
      <description01>
        <dd>
          In java,everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it
          is based on the Object model.
        </dd>
      </description01>
      <dt>Platform Independent</dt>
      <dd>
        Unlike many other languages including C and C++when Java is compiledit
        is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform<br>Independent
        byte code. This byte code is over the web and interpreted by the Virtual
        Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
      </dd>
      <dt>Simple</dt>
      <dd>
        Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic
        concept of <em>OOP Java,</em> It would be easy to master.
      </dd>
      <dt>Secure</dt>
      <dd>
        With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free
        systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption
      </dd>
      <dt>Architecture-neutral</dt>
      <dd>
        Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format,
        which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the
        presence of Java runtime system.
      </dd>
      <dt>Portable</dt>
      <dd>
        Being architecture-neutral and having no dependent aspects of the
        specification makes Java portable.<em
          >Compiler in Java is writion in ANSI C</em
        >
        with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset
      </dd>
      <dt>Robust</dt>
      <description07>
        <dd>
          Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by
          emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime
          checking.
